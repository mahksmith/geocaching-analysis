Exploring Algorithms and Applications related to Geocaching

Currently achieved:
* Website Interaction: Get list of PocketQueries. These will be downloaded on demand as required. They are compared to the database versions and not downloaded if they have not updated.

Future:
* I want to run this as a server, generating jobs to do such as: checking PocketQueries hourly, downloading latest versions of geocaches minutely, generating statistics on the fly as logs change, automating website interaction.
* Create a WPF program to learn and demonstrate knowledge, connect to the server to display logs, check status of any jobs visually, change any settings of server.
* Create a ASP website to learn and demonstrate knowledge, display generated statistics and logs.
